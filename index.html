          <h3>LifeAt<time>Nov 2022 - May 2025</time></h3>
          <h4>Senior Software Engineer</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              As an early member, I helped a productivity application reach its
              first 3,000 active subscribers and 50,000 daily active users.
              Frequently shipped new features and bugfixes to all parts of the
              service including the React frontend, Electron desktop app, and
              the serverless Firebase functions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Managed a team of 1 senior developer and 2 junior developers to
              launch a new product. This included onboarding the team to the
              codebase, regularly aligning on the product requirements, and
              conducting code reviews to quickly make key technical decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Optimized the product website for search engines. Impressions
              increased from 14k to 27k. Click counts increased by 100%. The
              strategy to tie our various contents spread across multiple
              platforms into a single domain with reverse proxy and canonical
              URLs was the key to this success.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conducted a cost audit across the infrastructure to save database
              cost by 80% and backend server cost by 75%. GCP cost analysis was
              done on Big Query to narrow down the most expensive resources,
              followed by a set of caching strategies to reduce the overall
              network traffic.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improved the CI/CD pipeline to increase product release
              consistency. This allowed the engineering team to release changes
              with more confidence. Older pipeline failed a few times a week and
              had a chance of omitting important backend changes. The new
              pipeline was made more reliable by deploying all changed modules
              and better handling GCP rate limits and errors.
            </li>
            <li>Scaled a newsletter from 0 to 700,000 active subscribers.</li>

          <h4>Software Developer</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Developed a technical assessment platform for hiring software
              developers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conducted technical feasibility analyses by building out software
              prototypes for business concepts from the leadership.
            </li>
            <li>
              Led Typescript adoption & Python 2-to-3 migration. Proposed a
              multi-phase plan to eliminate this huge tech debt without halting
              the production.
            </li>
            <li>
              Integrated the product with external services like GitHub, Slack,
              and Airtable while ensuring the product's reliability.
